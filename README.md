# Configuration files for ZMK firmware

This directory contains the configuration files for the Corne Wireless split keyboard.

It uses **BLE master/slave mode** (from `corne_*` shields) with:
- left half  as central (master),
- right half as peripheral (slave),
- both halves using nice!view OLEDs.

The setup is designed for a consistent and descriptive BLE name:  `Full Metal Corne`
